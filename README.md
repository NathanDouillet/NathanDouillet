# Hi there 👋

I am Nathan, a French engineering student 👨‍💻

#### What I do and How I do it 🧠👉💻

I build **web** app/site using **React**, **GatsbyJS**, **NextJS**, **Storybook**, I make my docs with **Docusaurus** and I used to deploy  with **Netlify**
In *front-end* I am also interested in **VueJS** and I would like to get into **Typescript**

I have made *mobile apps* using **Expo**, I have done a little bit of **Flutter** and I would like to learn **Swift**

For *back-end*, I use **lambda functions**, I have touched a bit of **NodeJS / Express**, I am curious about **Deno** and interested in **Ruby on Rails**

I have also know **Bash**, **Python**, and **C / C++** 

I also use these fantastic products every day 🤩: **Loom**, **Figma**, **Slack**, **Notion**

### Open to relocate ✈️🌍
Since I have lived in 5 different country on 4 continents, I cannot stay in place 🏃‍♂️

**Europe 🏰** : Vienna, Amsterdam, London
**Asia Pacific 🏯🦘** : Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, HK, Australia
**America 🗽** : SF or NY

Of course I am also open to full remote
